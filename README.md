# step_counter_with_wakeLock
a test to try and have the wakelock keeping the step_counter awake, as it actually turns off as soon as the screen goes off. 
I have modified the code from https://github.com/theelfismike/android-step-counter to check if with WakeLock helps with my Samsung S4: it does not
 Can anyone help?
